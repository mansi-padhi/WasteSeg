                                                        WasteSeg: Automated waste segregation using the Hugging Face Yan50 model

WasteSeg is a project focused on developing an automated waste segregation system using the Hugging Face Yan50 model for garbage classification. This system aims to categorize waste into different types, facilitating efficient waste management and promoting recycling practices. 

Problem
Manual waste segregation is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inefficient process, especially in contexts with a large amount of waste generated, such as cities. The increasing volume of waste highlights the need for automated solutions to improve efficiency, reduce pollution, and encourage responsible disposal practices. 

Solution
WasteSeg utilizes image recognition and the Hugging Face Yan50 pre-trained model to identify and classify waste materials. The system analyzes images captured by a camera and applies the model to categorize the waste. By automating this process, WasteSeg aims to: 
Reduce the workload on human workers.
Increase efficiency in waste segregation.
Minimize environmental pollution.
Promote proper waste disposal practices and raise awareness about different waste types. 

Features
Automated waste classification using the Hugging Face Yan50 model.
Leverages the power of pre-trained deep learning models for efficient classification.
Potential for real-time waste analysis and sorting (depending on implementation details).
Scalability for household and potentially industrial applications. 

How to run it
This project will likely have a separate frontend (e.g., built with React) and backend (e.g., built with Flask or FastAPI) to handle the image classification requests to the Hugging Face model. 
Frontend (assuming React.js)
Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
cd frontend 
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
bash
npm install 
# or if you are using yarn
yarn install
Use code with caution.

Start the frontend development server:
bash
npm start

This will usually open your React application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. 
Backend (assuming Flask or FastAPI)
Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
cd backend 
Use code with caution.

Run the backend application:
If using Flask (e.g., with app.py):
bash
python app.py

Your Flask backend will typically run on http://localhost:5000.
If using FastAPI (e.g., with main.py):
bash
uvicorn main:app --reload 
Use code with caution.

 
Running Frontend and Backend concurrently
You can use a tool like concurrently to run both the frontend and backend with a single command from your project root: 
Install concurrently (if not already installed):
bash
npm install concurrently --save-dev
Use code with caution.

This will start both your React frontend and your Python backend, allowing them to communicate and process image classification requests through the Hugging Face Yan50 model. 
Potential future scope
Exploring different deep learning architectures to improve accuracy and efficiency in classification.
Integrating with hardware systems for autonomous waste sorting and disposal.
Developing a user-friendly interface or mobile application for interacting with the system and tracking waste disposal efforts.
Expanding the scope of waste categories recognized to include more granular differentiation (e.g., specific plastic types, e-waste).
